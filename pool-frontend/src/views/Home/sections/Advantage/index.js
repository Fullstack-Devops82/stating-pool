      <h3>Our Advantage</h3>
      <p>
        What sets us apart is that we value our customers and focused our
        project to be secure and user friendly. Through using PoolPays, it
        reduces the need for high amounts of coins to stake and our users donâ€™t
        have to worry about setting up the infrastructure to support staking.
        Our payouts are fast and will make the overall coin staking process much
        easier for POS cryptocurrency holders.
